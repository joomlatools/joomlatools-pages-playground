# joomlatools-gitpod-pages
A super simple way to test out the brilliant new tool Joomlatools-pages from a gitpod repo containing a Joomla installation.

Just visit /hello-world in the gitpod browser, to see your first Joomlatools-page.

Watch the terminal output below, and when you see `A service is available on port 8080` click `Open Preview` or `Open Browser`

*Note* The first time your build your gitpod repo, the docker images have to built from scratch... Subsequent times you launch the same gitpod from your workspace area:
https://gitpod.io/workspaces/

Will be significantly faster.

Happy coding!
